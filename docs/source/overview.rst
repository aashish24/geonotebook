Overview
=======================================

GeoNotebook is an extension to the `Jupyter Notebook <http://jupyter.org>`_ that provides interactive visualization and python-based analysis of geospatial data. It is built with open source tools and is being jointly developed by `Kitware <http://www.kitware.com>`_ and `NASA Ames <https://www.nasa.gov/centers/ames/home/index.html>`_.

Goals
^^^^^

GeoNotebook's concrete goals are to provide a web based analysis tool that:

  #. Supports reproducible, exploratory analysis with a focus on geospatial data and formats.
  #. Provides easy deployment of a secure analysis environment close to where data is stored.
  #. Can be extended to support a wide array of data access and visualization contexts.
