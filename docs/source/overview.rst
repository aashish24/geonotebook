Overview
=======================================

GeoNotebook is an extension to the `Jupyter Notebook <http://jupyter.org>`_ that provides interactive visualization and python-based analysis of geospatial data. It is built with open source tools and is being jointly developed by `Kitware <http://www.kitware.com>`_ and `NASA Ames <https://www.nasa.gov/centers/ames/home/index.html>`_.

Goals
^^^^^

GeoNotebook's concrete goals are to provide a web based analysis tool that:

  #. Supports reproducible, exploratory analysis with a focus on geospatial data and formats.
  #. Provides easy deployment of a secure analysis environment close to where data is stored.
  #. Can be extended to support a wide array of data access and visualization contexts.

Audience
^^^^^^^^

GeoNotebook is designed to appeal too, and hopefully meet the needs of, several audiences:

  * Geospatial experts who are interested in using state of the art data science tools like the Jupyter Notebook to explore their data and share their findings.
  * Data scientists who are already using the python data analyitics stack (e.g. numpy, pandas, matplotlib, jupyter, etc) but find curren geospatial libraries to be confusing or burdensome.
  * Technical managers of large quantities of geospatial data who are looking to maximize usage by provide analysis environments that are "closer" their data.
